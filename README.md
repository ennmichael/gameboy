# Gameboy

This is a project consiting of two programs: a snake clone and a tetris clone.
Some time after writing this project,
I rewrote the tetris clone in C and installed on PIC16 hardware -
https://github.com/ennmichael/pic16-tetris.

For the snake game, use the arrow keys to move. There's an experimental feature
where the snake can be controlled by (somewhat poor) AI. Run `./Snake --ai` or
`Snake.exe --ai` to start the program in AI mode.

For the tetris game, use the left and right keys to move blocks, down key to
make them fall faster, x and y, or x and z to rotate them.
